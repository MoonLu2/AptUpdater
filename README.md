# AptUpdater
I created this out of bordom and laziness of always having to remember all the apt pkg commands on linux.

This is an environment for Debian's apt which allows you to update a single (of your choice) or all packages, while using apt --list-upgradable to list everything you'd need.

### Use this with python3, and I recomment running - python3 (path-to-file) - in the terminal.
